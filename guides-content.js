        <h2>2. The meter block — how your units were counted</h2>
        <p>Units billed = (Current reading − Previous reading) × <strong>MF</strong> (multiplying
        factor). For almost all domestic meters MF is 1, so the subtraction alone is your consumption.
        Two things to check every month:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meter status code.</strong> "OK" means an actual reading. Codes like
          <strong>IDF</strong> (Inaccessible Due to Factors) or <strong>RDF</strong> (Reading Defective)
          mean UPPCL <em>estimated</em> your usage — expect a catch-up adjustment when a real reading
          finally happens.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading dates.</strong> A billing period longer than ~30 days pushes more units
          into higher slabs and inflates the bill even at normal usage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>3. The charges table — every line, in billing order</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Energy charge.</strong> Your units priced through the LMV-1 slab schedule.
          UP domestic slabs step up with consumption, so heavy months cost more per unit.
          Current slab rates for your DISCOM are on our
          <a href="/tariffs/uttar-pradesh/">Uttar Pradesh tariff pages</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed charge.</strong> A flat ₹-per-kW-per-month amount multiplied by your
          sanctioned load. It's payable even at zero consumption.</li>
          <li><strong>FPPA / fuel surcharge.</strong> The Fuel and Power Purchase Adjustment recovers
          changes in UPPCL's power-purchase cost. Under UP's current framework it's applied as a
          percentage of your energy charge and is revised periodically — read our
          <a href="/guides/why-did-my-electricity-bill-increase/">bill-increase guide</a> if this
          line suddenly appeared.</li>
          <li><strong>Electricity duty (ED).</strong> A state levy applied <em>after</em> FPPA is
          added — i.e. as a percentage of energy + fixed + FPPA, per the tariff schedule.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrears and LPSC.</strong> Unpaid past amounts carried forward, plus a late
          payment surcharge of about 1.25% per month on dues.</li>
          <li><strong>Subsidy / adjustment.</strong> Government subsidy (where applicable) and any
          credits from earlier over-billing appear as negative lines.</li>

        a: 'LMV-1 is the Low/Medium Voltage domestic (residential) tariff category in Uttar Pradesh. It covers household connections and determines the slab rates and fixed charge per kW applied to your bill. Commercial connections fall under LMV-2.' },
      { q: 'What does IDF mean on my UPPCL bill?',
        a: 'IDF ("Inaccessible Due to Factors") means the meter reader could not take an actual reading, so the month was billed on an estimate. Once a real reading is taken, the difference is adjusted — which can cause a suddenly large catch-up bill.' },
      { q: 'What is the multiplying factor (MF) on an electricity bill?',
        a: 'MF converts the meter’s internal count into actual units where current transformers are used. Billed units = (current reading − previous reading) × MF. Domestic meters almost always have MF = 1; a wrong MF multiplies your whole bill.' },
      { q: 'How is electricity duty calculated on UP bills?',

    metaTitle: 'Why Did My Electricity Bill Suddenly Increase? 8 Causes to Check',
    description: 'The 8 most common reasons an Indian electricity bill jumps — slab escalation, catch-up after estimated readings, FPPA revisions, seasonal AC load, arrears with LPSC, meter faults, excess-load penalties — and exactly how to check each one.',
    minutes: 7,
    intro: `A bill that doubles without warning usually has a mundane explanation — and it's rarely
      "the meter is fast". Work through these eight causes in order: they're ranked from most to
      least common, and each comes with a concrete way to check it on your own bill.`,
    sections: `
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>1. Seasonal appliance load (the AC effect)</h2>
        <p>A single 1.5-ton AC draws roughly 1.2–1.6 kW. Run it 8 hours a night and that's
        <strong>~300 extra units a month</strong> — often more than the rest of the house combined.
        <em>Check:</em> compare this month's units (not rupees) with the same month <strong>last
        year</strong>, not last month. Our <a href="/usage/">usage estimator</a> converts your
        appliances into expected units.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>2. Slab escalation — extra units cost more per unit</h2>
        <p>Indian domestic tariffs are slabbed: the price per unit steps up as monthly consumption
        rises. Crossing a slab boundary means the extra units are billed at the higher rate, so a
        30% rise in usage can produce a 45% rise in the energy charge.
        <em>Check:</em> find your slab boundaries on your DISCOM's
        <a href="/tariffs/">tariff page</a>, then see which side of them your recent months fall.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>3. Catch-up after estimated readings</h2>
        <p>If earlier bills carried a status like IDF/RDF or "average", you were billed on
        estimates. When an actual reading finally happens, all under-billed units land at once —
        and because of slab escalation they land at the <em>highest</em> rates.
        <em>Check:</em> the meter-status code and reading dates on the last 3–4 bills.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>4. FPPA / fuel surcharge revision</h2>
        <p>The Fuel and Power Purchase Adjustment passes changes in your DISCOM's power-purchase
        cost through to you, and it's revised periodically (monthly or quarterly depending on the
        state). A new or increased FPPA line raises the bill with zero change in your usage.
        <em>Check:</em> compare the FPPA line across two bills with similar units.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>5. Arrears and late-payment surcharge (LPSC)</h2>
        <p>A missed or partial payment carries forward as arrears and accrues LPSC (typically around
        1.25–1.5% per month). The current bill then looks inflated even though current-month charges
        are normal. <em>Check:</em> the arrears line — current charges and arrears are always shown
        separately.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>6. Tariff order revision</h2>
        <p>State regulators (SERCs) issue revised tariff schedules, usually effective April–June.
        Slab rates, fixed charges or duty may have changed since your last "normal" bill.
        <em>Check:</em> the tariff year printed on the bill against your DISCOM's
        <a href="/tariffs/">current schedule</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>7. Excess load penalty</h2>
        <p>If your recorded demand exceeds the sanctioned load, many DISCOMs bill the excess kW at a
        penal fixed-charge rate. Common after adding an AC or motor without upgrading the sanctioned
        load. <em>Check:</em> "recorded/billed demand" vs "sanctioned load" on the bill.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>8. Meter fault or wrong multiplying factor</h2>
        <p>Genuinely faulty meters are the rarest cause, but a wrong MF after a meter replacement
        multiplies everything. <em>Check:</em> units = (current − previous) × MF by hand. If the
        printed units don't match, apply for a meter test (a small fee, refundable in many states
        if the meter is found faulty).</p>

    faqs: [
      { q: 'Why is my electricity bill high even though usage is the same?',
        a: 'With unchanged units, the usual culprits are a revised FPPA/fuel surcharge, a new tariff order, arrears with late-payment surcharge from a missed payment, or a catch-up adjustment after months of estimated readings. Compare the individual charge lines — not just the total — across two bills with similar units.' },
      { q: 'How do I check if my electricity meter is faulty?',
        a: 'First verify the arithmetic: billed units should equal (current reading − previous reading) × MF. Then run a self-test: note the reading, run a known load (e.g. a 1 kW heater) for exactly one hour, and confirm the meter advanced by ~1 unit. If it deviates significantly, apply to your DISCOM for an official meter test.' },
      { q: 'What is FPPA and why does it change my bill?',
        a: 'FPPA (Fuel and Power Purchase Adjustment) is a surcharge that passes changes in the DISCOM’s fuel and power-purchase costs to consumers, applied per-unit or as a percentage of energy charges depending on the state. Because it is revised periodically, your bill can rise or fall with no change in your consumption.' },
      { q: 'Can I get a wrong electricity bill corrected?',
        a: 'Yes. Raise a billing complaint with your DISCOM (keep the complaint number), and escalate to the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum if unresolved. Estimated-reading catch-ups, wrong category, wrong MF and duplicate arrears are all correctable. Our free expert Bill Review can help you build the case.' },

    minutes: 5,
    intro: `Time-of-Day (ToD) billing prices a unit of electricity differently depending on
      <strong>when</strong> you consume it: more during evening peak hours, less (often a rebate)
      during off-peak and solar hours. It has long applied to commercial and industrial consumers,
      and with smart meters it is progressively reaching domestic consumers across India.`,
    sections: `
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>Why ToD exists</h2>
        <p>Electricity is expensive to supply when everyone wants it at once (evenings) and cheap
        when solar generation floods the grid (midday). ToD passes that cost signal to you: shift
        flexible loads away from the peak and both you and the grid save. Under the national
        framework, ToD tariffs are mandatory for most commercial/industrial consumers and roll out
        to domestic consumers as smart meters are installed.</p>

      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>How the rate structure works</h2>
        <p>Your DISCOM's tariff order splits the day into windows, each with a surcharge or rebate
        applied on top of the normal energy rate. A typical structure (exact windows and percentages
        vary by state — check your DISCOM's <a href="/tariffs/">tariff page</a>):</p>
        <div class="comparison-table-wrapper"><table class="comparison-table">

            <tr><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Daytime outside solar/peak windows</td><td>Standard energy rate</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Off-peak / solar</strong></td><td>Late night, and ~9 am – 4 pm solar hours</td><td>−10% to −20% rebate</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table></div>
        <p>Your meter records consumption per window; the bill then shows a ToD surcharge/rebate
        line alongside the normal energy charge.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="seo-section">
        <h2>ToD vs kVAh billing — not the same thing</h2>
        <p>ToD changes the price by <em>time</em>. <strong>kVAh billing</strong> changes the
        quantity being measured: instead of kWh (real energy) you're billed on kVAh (apparent
        energy), which includes reactive power. A poor power factor makes kVAh exceed kWh, so the
        same appliances cost more. Many DISCOMs apply both to commercial/industrial connections —
        our <a href="/#calculator">calculator</a> supports both where a DISCOM uses them.</p>

          make this automatic).</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-cool before the peak:</strong> run the AC harder in the cheap solar window
          and ease it during 6–10 pm.</li>
          <li><strong>Pair with rooftop solar:</strong> daytime self-consumption already offsets the
          window where grid power is cheapest, so size the system for your evening needs — see our
          <a href="/solar/">solar savings estimator</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Mind the batch loads:</strong> for shops and small industry, moving compressor,
          pumping or refrigeration-defrost cycles off the evening peak is usually the single biggest win.</li>

      </section>`,
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Does ToD billing apply to home (domestic) connections?',
        a: 'Increasingly, yes. ToD has long been mandatory for most commercial and industrial consumers; under India’s smart-metering framework it extends to domestic consumers once a smart meter is installed, with peak surcharges and solar-hour rebates defined in each state’s tariff order.' },
      { q: 'What are typical peak hours for electricity in India?',
        a: 'Evening peak is typically around 6 pm to 10 pm, and many states also define a morning peak. Solar hours (roughly 9 am to 4 pm) are increasingly treated as the cheapest window. Exact windows are set by each state’s regulator and printed in the tariff order.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between kWh and kVAh billing?',
        a: 'kWh measures real energy consumed; kVAh measures apparent energy, which also reflects reactive power drawn by motors and poor-power-factor equipment. Under kVAh billing, a power factor below 1 inflates billable units — improving power factor (e.g. with capacitors) directly cuts the bill.' },
      { q: 'Can ToD billing reduce my bill?',
        a: 'Yes — if you shift flexible loads (EV charging, pumping, laundry, water heating) into off-peak or solar-rebate windows, the same total consumption costs less. Consumers who cannot shift any load away from evening hours may see a small increase instead.' },
